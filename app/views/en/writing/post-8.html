    <span class="govuk-caption-l">Writing about these prototypes</span>
    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Testing card payments</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">After considering other ways to pay, we decided not to spend time testing over the phone payments, given the extra security requirements. So we settled upon card payments online.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The three variations we tested were:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Payment page hosted on GOV.UK Pay</li>
        <li>Validating just the reference number (UTRN)</li>
        <li>Full check and pay balance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment payment - no validation</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The first option we prototyped, is a page generated by and hosted on GOV.UK Pay. As mentioned in the last post, these payment pages are very cheap and quick to make. All that is needed is a GOV.UK Pay admin login.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-s"><a href="/en/prototype/v6/payment-page/service-description">View payment page prototype</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">However, there is no validation. Meaning someone can enter any amount and reference number, which would cause matching headaches and potentially more debt.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Validate reference number (UTRN)</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The second option, does validate reference number (UTRN), meaning someone in this example, wouldn’t pay without it matching to a balance. It then hands off to GOV.UK Pay to take the card details and process the payment.</p>

      <video width="100%" controls autoplay loop id="writing-image" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">

      <p class="govuk-body-s"><a href="/en/prototype/v6/just-utrn-validated/start-page">View validate UTRN prototype</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The limitations are someone still needs to enter the right amount. Despite knowing its a real reference number, the prototype doesn’t show someone a balance. The reason being, at the time of writing this point, the team is not confident it can display an accurate balance for all taxpayers. While yes it can do simple calculations, for example, someone who owes a little interest, more complicated cases still give inaccurate numbers, like amendments and local council as purchasers.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Check and pay balance</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">In theory this is the best option, by functionality. When someone enters a reference number (UTRN), they view the exact balance, before being handed over to GOV.UK Pay to process the payment. All matched with the right amount and reference.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body-s"><a href="/en/prototype/v6/show-amount/balance">View check and pay balance prototype</a></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some potential downsides for this prototype:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Much software development involved</li>
        <li>Making sensitive tax data more accessible</li>
        <li>Designing a check balance screen easily understandable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we learned</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Do our current taxpayers need card payments? In short, probably not.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">92% Land Transaction Tax is paid by agents, such as conveyancers. In a survey of 175 agents, about card payments, we learned:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>89% of agents pay by BACs or CHAPs bank transfers</li>
        <li>89.5% of agents find the current ways of paying easy or very easy</li>
        <li>28% of agents said yes, when asked if they wanted other payment methods from WRA</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How did the prototypes go down?</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">he testing of the prototypes themselves was limited to WRA staff.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The third option, check and pay balance, tested best. The main difference between this option and the other two, was validation. The first two options don’t validate the amount and one does the reference number. While staff were able to navigate through the screens unassisted, they expressed worry that the lack of validation would mean more payments were unmatched or simply the wrong amount.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The team decided not to continue with payments in the short term. The survey and prototype testing showed there was an obvious need for enough users and the best option would involve a lot of software development to make a reliable public site.
